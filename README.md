# todo
In-Browser TODO app with Javascript and jQuery

# Intention

Intention is to create a simple-to-use TODO app that
- Can run on browser wihtout the need of internet connection
- Has zero or least set up
- Has no module installation, least dependency
- Needs no server or backend
- Can still be able to persist data (in browser) using WebSQL

So, the 'stack' is merely Javascript.

# Demo

Overall app looks like this:

This is devided mainly into 3 sections:
- Left : Information section
- Center: Add new task and listing of tasks
- Right: Action buttons

Adding a new task is as easy as typing into the text field and pressing Enter key
